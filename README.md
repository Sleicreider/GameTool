# GameTool

This project should make it easier to see all important PC infos in one window.
Recently I stared to care more about my cpu/ram/wifi usage, because of some hardware problems
or network problems, and I always were really annoyed to use windows taskmanager (too much unecessary info and not in one place) and other tools for cpu/gpu temperature.

They were also not that easy to use.

Therefore I just came up with the idea, of a small customizeable window, where you can choose what you want to see.
With simple access while playing without being to annoying to you as a gamer.


For now this is Windows only, since I'm no linux user (classic game dev)
and don't have a mac at the moment.
But it will be  designed with crossplatform in mind, therefore I'll be using QT for GUI, everything else will be done
in raw c++
